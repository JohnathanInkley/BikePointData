Make program handle web data reader exceptions properly
Test web data reader better
Make WebDataReader not close every time it is used - perhaps it permanently produces the data
/Create class responsible for constantly updating the current bike data and providing a way for taking a copy
Create dispatcher that launches a new query and gets data from the bikeDataDispenser
+Make tool to filter bike data by location - maybe user can type location and we have data base of locations and lat/long pairs
    - google maps API key AIzaSyDuzsl1bwFRRwvwUSNkkm5sAs8rb05AyEI
    - we can get location's co-ords from google geocoding api
    - for a given radius, we can get max and min lat/long to give an effective search area
    - Then can loop over hash-map and effectively choose stops

Future idea, work out expected number of bikes in a given amount of  time, so if user needs to choose between two locations
they can see which is more likely to have free spaces in say 30 mins time


---- Immediate to dos -----
/A map of stops to locations - and a way to read them in from file
/Take a users latitude/longitude as current location
/Give bike stop entry a location rather than two int fields
A predicate to calculate min lat/long for a given distance r from a (lat,long) pair
A method to search over map of locations and return keys by filtering on the function above
Some other class than can the get these keys, and produce a map of stops and free bikes, ranked by distance or by number of free bikes
Maybe a simple predict feature that looks at last X bike maps, and calculates a crude derivate to guess next bike map?
