Make program handle web data reader exceptions properly
Test web data reader better
Make WebDataReader not close every time it is used - perhaps it permanently produces the data
Create dispatcher that launches a new query and gets data from the bikeDataDispenser

Future idea, work out expected number of bikes in a given amount of  time, so if user needs to choose between two locations
they can see which is more likely to have free spaces in say 30 mins time
Maybe a simple predict feature that looks at last X bike maps, and calculates a crude derivate to guess next bike map?
