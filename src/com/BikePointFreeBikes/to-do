Make program handle web data reader exceptions properly
Test web data reader better
Make WebDataReader not close every time it is used - perhaps it permanently produces the data
Create dispatcher that launches a new query and gets data from the bikeDataDispenser

Future idea, work out expected number of bikes in a given amount of  time, so if user needs to choose between two locations
they can see which is more likely to have free spaces in say 30 mins time

Maybe a simple predict feature that looks at last X bike maps, and calculates a crude derivate to guess next bike map?

---- Immediate to dos -----
+Make tool to filter bike data by location - maybe user can type location and we have data base of locations and lat/long pairs
    - google maps API key AIzaSyDuzsl1bwFRRwvwUSNkkm5sAs8rb05AyEI
    - we can get location's co-ords from google geocoding api
    - for a given radius, we can get max and min lat/long to give an effective search area
    - Then can loop over hash-map and effectively choose stops

/Function that processes string into google's required syntax
Function that takes string and returns it's location from google


Should start() take the number of expected clients?
